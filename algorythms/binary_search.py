# The first line contains an integer 1 <= n <= 10^5 and an array A[1...n] of n distinct natural numbers
# not exceeding 10^9 in ascending order, the second - an integer 1 <= k <= 10^5 and k natural numbers b1,...,bk
# not exceeding 10^9. For each i from 1 to k you need to print the index 1 <= j <= n for which A[j] = bi or -1
# if there is no such j.

# Sample Input:
# 5 1 5 8 12 13
# 5 8 1 23 1 11

# Sample Output:
# 3 1 -1 1 -1
