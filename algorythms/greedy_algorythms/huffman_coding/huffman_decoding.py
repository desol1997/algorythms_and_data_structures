# Restore the string by its code and unprefixed character code.

# The first line of the input file contains two space-separated integers
# k and l â€” the number of different letters in the string and the size of the resulting encoded string, respectively.
# The next k lines contain letter codes in the format "letter: code". Neither code is a prefix of another.
# The letters can be listed in any order.
# Only lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet can be used as letters;
# each of these letters occurs at least once in the string.
# Finally, the last line contains the encoded string. The original string and codes of all letters are non-empty.
# The given code is such that the encoded string has the smallest possible size.

# In the first line of the output file print the line s.
# It must consist of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.
# It is guaranteed that the length of the correct answer does not exceed 10^4 characters.

# Sample Input 1:
# 1 1
# a: 0
# 0

# Sample Output 1:
# a

# Sample Input 2:
# 4 14
# a: 0
# b: 10
# c: 110
# d: 111
# 01001100100111

# Sample Output 2:
# abacabad
